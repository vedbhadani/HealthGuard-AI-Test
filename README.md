# 🩺 Intelligent Patient Risk Assessment System (Milestone 1)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Machine Learning-based healthcare analytics system that predicts diabetes risk using structured clinical data.

The system analyzes patient health indicators and provides:

- Risk probability (%)
- Risk category (Low / Moderate / High)
- Top contributing clinical factors

This project fulfills **Milestone 1: ML-Based Patient Risk Assessment**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder affecting millions globally. Early risk detection is critical to prevent long-term complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and nerve damage.

This system aims to:

- Predict diabetes risk using structured clinical features
- Provide interpretable risk explanations
- Support preliminary screening and preventive care

⚠️ This system is intended for educational purposes only and does not replace professional medical diagnosis.
